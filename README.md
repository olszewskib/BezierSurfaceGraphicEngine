## Overview

Welcome to the BezierSurface Graphic Engine project! This project is a graphics engine that utilizes Bezier surfaces to create smooth and realistic 3D surfaces. The engine supports textures, normal maps, and lighting to enhance the visual quality of rendered scenes.

## Features

### Bezier Surfaces

The core of the engine is built around Bezier surfaces, which allow for the creation of complex and curved 3D shapes. This provides a high level of flexibility in designing surfaces, making it suitable for a variety of applications, from game development to architectural visualization.

### Texture Mapping

The engine supports texture mapping, enabling the application of detailed textures onto Bezier surfaces. This feature adds a level of realism to the rendered scenes by allowing for the representation of surface details such as wood grains, stone patterns, or other intricate designs.

### Normal Maps

Normal mapping is employed to simulate surface details and enhance the perception of depth in the rendered images. This technique is particularly useful for creating visually appealing surfaces without the need for additional geometric complexity.

### Lighting

The engine incorporates lighting effects to simulate realistic illumination of scenes. Different lighting models, such as ambient, diffuse, and specular lighting, contribute to creating visually stunning and dynamic environments.


# New Project

> âœ¨ Bootstrapped with Create Snowpack App (CSA).

## Available Scripts

### npm start

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:8080 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### npm run build

Builds a static copy of your site to the `build/` folder.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

**For the best production performance:** Add a build bundler plugin like [@snowpack/plugin-webpack](https://github.com/snowpackjs/snowpack/tree/main/plugins/plugin-webpack) or [snowpack-plugin-rollup-bundle](https://github.com/ParamagicDev/snowpack-plugin-rollup-bundle) to your `snowpack.config.mjs` config file.

### Q: What about Eject?

No eject needed! Snowpack guarantees zero lock-in, and CSA strives for the same.
